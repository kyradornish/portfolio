          <h3>Hi!</h3>
          <p>My name is Kyra Dornish. I'm a midwestern girl who moved to the DC area a
            little over a year ago. I have a wonderful husband, Tommy, and 3 mischievous cats.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2013 with a bachelors
          in Psychology and 2015 with a masters in International Family Studies. From
          there I started working in customer support at Hudl, a sports technology company,
          in Lincoln, NE. I moved into a role on the Facilities team at
          <a href="https://www.hudl.com/">Hudl</a> then moved to DC
          for an opportunity to manage the Facilities team at <a href="https://www.ijm.org/">
            International Justice Mission</a>.</p>

        <h3>Why Web Development</h3>
          <p>I took a web development course in college and really enjoyed it, but
            didn't have enough skill to puruse it as a career. Moving to DC has given
            me the opportunity to learn how to become a developer through a bootcamp. And I consider
            starting a family, I want to be in a career I love. I am excited
            to give this long time interest a try and set my family up well for the future! </p>
